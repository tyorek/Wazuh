If you want to get a feel for a siem this script from Wazuh's website will help you get started easily. I do not recommend running this on arm64 platforms such as raspberry pi because it will not work. It is recommended to run it on an amd64 x86_64 platform. 
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.14/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
